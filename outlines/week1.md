# 31 Days of Vibe Coding – Week 1 (Days 1–7)

---

## Day 1 – What Is Vibe Coding?

**Abstract:**  
Vibe Coding is the art of staying in flow while using AI as your creative pair-programmer. It’s not about outsourcing your brain; it’s about accelerating intuition. This post defines the practice, the mindset, and the rules of engagement—and why observability becomes your new seatbelt when you’re no longer the only one writing code.

### Outline
1. **Opening Anecdote** – Describe the first time you felt “in flow” with an AI model.  
2. **Definition** – Vibe Coding as iterative human-AI co-creation.  
3. **Core Principles** – Speed, Intent, Flow, Observability.  
4. **Why Now** – The explosion of capable code models and shifting developer expectations.  
5. **Trust and Verification** – Why instrumented, observable systems matter more than ever.  
6. **Preview of the Series** – 31 days to rebuild your relationship with code.

### Asset Notes
- None yet; visual diagram showing “human ↔ AI ↔ system metrics” loop.  
- Optional link to a GitHub README introducing the project.

### Call to Action
- Subscribe to the series or repo watchlist.  
- Analytics idea: track newsletter sign-ups and GitHub stars.

## Day 2 – The AI Coding Landscape: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot

**Abstract:**  
A side-by-side comparison of today’s leading AI coding partners. We’ll give each the same challenge, examine the results, and talk about how instrumentation and observability reveal the truth behind “smart” code.

### Outline
1. **Setup** – Explain the test scenario (e.g., small API build).  
2. **The Contenders** – Quick intros to Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot.  
3. **The Challenge** – Define evaluation criteria: accuracy, readability, observability.  
4. **Results & Analysis** – Where each shines or falls flat.  
5. **Real-World Fit** – Mapping tools to use cases.  
6. **The Meta Takeaway** – No model is “best”; pick by vibe and context.

### Asset Notes
- GitHub folder `/day02-model-comparison/` with challenge prompt + outputs.  
- Optional CSV of timing/performance metrics.

### Call to Action
- Try the challenge with your favorite model; submit results via PR.  
- Analytics: count forks or issue comments on repo.

## Day 3 – Prompt Like a Pro: Writing for Machines, Thinking Like a Dev

**Abstract:**  
Great prompts feel like good API design: clear contracts, explicit intent, graceful failure. Learn a repeatable framework for writing technical prompts that yield reliable, readable, testable code—including how to inject observability expectations right into the request.

### Outline
1. **Why Prompting Matters** – Garbage in, hallucination out.  
2. **Prompt Anatomy** – Context → Instruction → Constraint → Format.  
3. **The 10% Rule** – Start small, iterate often.  
4. **Prompting for Metrics** – Ask explicitly for logging/tracing hooks.  
5. **Prompt Anti-Patterns** – Over-specifying, role confusion, verbosity.  
6. **Template Library Intro** – Reusable prompt blocks for CRUD, tests, docs.

### Asset Notes
- `/day03-prompts/` folder with Markdown prompt templates.  
- Example prompt → code → test pipeline.

### Call to Action
- Download prompt templates; adapt one to your next project.  
- Analytics: track repo downloads or link clicks.

## Day 4 – Establishing Your Vibe: Context, Style, and Personality

**Abstract:**  
Your AI partner learns by example. Feed it your naming conventions, patterns, and humor so its code feels like yours. This post covers creating a “style primer” that keeps the AI aligned with your identity—and your team’s observability standards.

### Outline
1. **Defining ‘Vibe’** – Beyond syntax; it’s voice and intent.  
2. **Capturing Your Style Guide** – Examples, naming, commentary tone.  
3. **Feeding Context** – Using conversation history or files to teach.  
4. **Consistency Tools** – Using linters and formatters as reinforcement.  
5. **Team Alignment** – How shared vibe improves reviews and logs.  
6. **Sample Session** – Show a before/after with a tuned prompt.

### Asset Notes
- `/day04-style-primer/` JSON or Markdown style guide template.  
- Optional config examples for ESLint or Prettier.

### Call to Action
- Write your own style primer and share snippets in Issues.  
- Analytics: issue count or template pull requests.

## Day 5 – Building a Vibe-Ready Environment

**Abstract:**  
Flow requires frictionless tools. We’ll configure editors, terminals, and AI plug-ins so generation and verification happen in one place. Bonus: wiring up automatic traces to Dynatrace or any observability platform.

### Outline
1. **Philosophy of Flow** – Reduce context switching.  
2. **IDE Setup** – VS Code/Cursor tips, hotkeys, chat panes.  
3. **Version Control Hooks** – Auto-commit messages, diff prompts.  
4. **Observability Bootstrap** – Lightweight logging templates.  
5. **Ergonomics & Focus** – Shortcuts, themes, music, mindset.  
6. **Checklist for Day One** – Minimal viable vibe setup.

### Asset Notes
- `/day05-env-setup/` scripts and example settings.json.  
- Optional Dynatrace API snippet for local dev tracing.

### Call to Action
- Implement one environment tweak today and share on X with #VibeCoding.  
- Analytics: hashtag tracking + repo traffic.

## Day 6 – The Flow Loop: Iterate, Evaluate, Refine

**Abstract:**  
Vibe Coding is a rhythm: prompt → generate → evaluate → refine. We’ll show how short loops outperform big one-shot generations and how observability data can feed directly into those iterations.

### Outline
1. **Define the Loop** – Keep sessions under 5 minutes.  
2. **Set Clear End States** – Define “done” per loop.  
3. **Measuring Impact** – Use runtime metrics to verify changes.  
4. **The Double-Loop** – Human judgment + AI feedback.  
5. **Avoiding Drift** – Prevent losing context over long sessions.  
6. **Practical Demo** – Small feature built over four loops.

### Asset Notes
- `/day06-flow-loop/` sample notebook or shell transcript.  
- Optional metrics dashboard JSON.

### Call to Action
- Record your own flow loop and post takeaways.  
- Analytics: social engagement or video link clicks.

## Day 7 – Guardrails and Ground Truths

**Abstract:**  
AI can move fast—and break production. Learn to spot, test, and fix hallucinations before they ship. We’ll connect automated testing with runtime observability so your safety nets are as agile as your prompts.

### Outline
1. **Common Failure Modes** – Wrong assumptions, missing imports, silent fails.  
2. **Validation Patterns** – Unit tests, type checks, schema assertions.  
3. **Observability as Verifier** – Use logs/traces to catch anomalies.  
4. **Continuous Feedback** – Tie alerts back to AI-written commits.  
5. **The Human Override** – Knowing when to stop trusting the model.  
6. **Checklist** – Guardrail essentials for any AI-assisted repo.

### Asset Notes
- `/day07-guardrails/` example test suite + log config.  
- Script connecting CI tests to Dynatrace API.

### Call to Action
- Add one new guardrail to your project today.  
- Analytics: measure repo clones or CI pipeline runs.
