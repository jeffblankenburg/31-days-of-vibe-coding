# 31 Days of Vibe Coding

Welcome to **31 Days of Vibe Coding**, a guide to AI-assisted development for working developers who want to ship faster without sacrificing quality.

## What Is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is about staying in flow while using AI as your pair-programming partner. It's not about replacing your skills - it's about accelerating them. When you're vibe coding, you're still the architect. The AI is your junior developer, helping you iterate faster, explore alternatives, and maintain momentum from idea to production.

This isn't a series about "letting AI write code for you." It's about building reliable, observable, production-grade software faster by treating AI as a tool for developers who already know what they're doing.

## Who This Series Is For

This series is for **working developers** who:
- Already ship code to production
- Want to accelerate delivery without sacrificing quality
- Care about observability, testing, and maintainability
- Are curious about AI coding tools but skeptical of hype
- Need practical techniques, not theory

If you're looking for "AI will do everything" tutorials, this isn't that. If you want practical ways to build better systems faster, you're in the right place.

## How to Use This Repository

This repo contains:
- **`/articles`** - Full blog posts for each day
- **`/outlines`** - Planning documents and structure notes
- **`/examples`** - Code samples, prompts, and templates from the series
- **`/resources`** - Checklists, style guides, and reference materials

You can read the articles in order (recommended), or jump to specific topics that interest you. Each article includes:
- Real code examples
- Practical prompts you can use
- Hands-on exercises
- Links to additional resources

## The Blog

All articles are published daily at **[31daysofvibecoding.com](https://31daysofvibecoding.com)** throughout the series. This GitHub repo serves as the permanent home for all content, code, and community contributions.

## Contributing

Found a bug in example code? Have a better prompt? Want to share your vibe coding story?

- **Issues**: Report problems or suggest improvements
- **Pull Requests**: Submit corrections, enhancements, or your own examples
- **Discussions**: Share your experiences and learn from others

All contributions are welcome, whether you're team Claude, team Copilot, or vibing with something else entirely.

## About Observability

Throughout this series, you'll notice a consistent theme: **observability**. When you're shipping code faster with AI assistance, you need confidence that it works in production. That means logs, traces, metrics, and real-time feedback.

We'll show practical examples, but the principles apply regardless of your tooling. The goal is simple: trust, but verify.

## A Note on AI Tools

This series primarily uses **Claude** for examples, but the techniques work across AI coding tools. Day 2 specifically compares Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and GitHub Copilot so you can make informed choices for your context.

Use what works for your vibe. The principles matter more than the platform.

## Let's Build

Whether you're here to learn, experiment, or challenge the ideas, welcome. The future of development isn't AI *or* human - it's AI *and* human, working together.
